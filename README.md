## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Before coding you must layout how all pieces should interact and what can be nested and reused.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.arrow-down {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: -0.95rem;
  left: 50%;
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
  border-left: 1rem solid transparent;
  border-right: 1rem solid transparent;
  border-top: 1rem solid var(--DarkGrayishBlue);
}
```

The CSS code above creates the down-arrow which is used in destop-active state.

### Continued development

In previous projecs I struggled alot with the images. And in this project it was 'easier', but still needed some rework to get things 'right'.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle) - This helped me in creating the down-arrow. I was almost there my self, but after a couple of hours I googled ðŸ¤”
